- 🖖🏻 Hello there, I hope you enjoy your time in here. I am @TheMarioSalles.


- 👀 I’m interested in Geek & Tech contents such as new programming languages versions, new SDE tools and so on.


- 🌱 I’m currently learning about IT Management, .NET 6 Features and to be a better human being (but it seems the last one takes some time).


- 💞️ I’m thrilled to help develop a better world for us to live in. It includes the needed improvements I have to seek in order to do so.
